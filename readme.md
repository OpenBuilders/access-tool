# The Gateway â€“ Community Tool

## Summary

The Gateway is a comprehensive community management tool designed for blockchain and cryptocurrency communities. It provides a suite of features to help community managers track, engage with, and analyze their community members' activities.

### Key Features

- **Wallet Indexing**: Index blockchain wallets associated with community members
- **Transaction Lookup**: Track blockchain transactions for mentioned wallets
- **Community Management**: Tools for managing community members and activities
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Automated processes for regular community management activities

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI, Celery for task processing, Golang for transaction tracking
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, built with Vite
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Caching & Message Queue**: Redis
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Installation

To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Docker and Docker Compose must be installed on your machine
   - Python 3.11.6 and pip should be installed to set up the virtual environment
   - Node.js and Yarn for frontend development (if needed)

2. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/openbuilders/gateway-tool.git`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd gateway-tool`
   - Set up the Python virtual environment: `make setup-venv`
   - Configure environment variables (see Configuration section)
   - Build the Docker containers: `make build`
   - Start the application: `make run`

3. **Verification**:
   - The API should be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`
   - The frontend should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

## Configuration

The required configuration that should be set before any deployment is located in the following directories:

- `backend/api/config/.env`
- `backend/community_manager/config/.env`
- `backend/core/config/.env`
- `backend/indexer/config/.env`
- `backend/transaction-lookup/.env`

Prepare these files according to `.env.template` which you can find in the mentioned places.

### Environment Variables

Each component requires specific environment variables to be set. The most important ones include:

- Database connection details (in `backend/core/config/.env`)
- Redis connection details
- API keys for blockchain services
- Frontend API endpoint configuration

## Usage

### Available Commands

The project includes several make commands to simplify development and operation:

- `make build`: Build all Docker containers
- `make run`: Start all services
- `make stop`: Stop all services
- `make down`: Stop and remove containers
- `make restart`: Restart all services
- `make migrate`: Run database migrations
- `make test`: Run tests
