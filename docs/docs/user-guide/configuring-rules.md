# Configuring New Rules

Rules define who is allowed to enter or stay in a chat.

## Types of Rules
- **Whitelist**: Specify users or groups that are always allowed.
- **Blacklist**: Specify users or groups that are never allowed.
- **External Source**: Fetch a list of allowed users from an external API or file.

## Creating a Rule
1. Go to the "Rules" section for a specific chat.
2. Click "Add Rule".
3. Select the rule type and provide the necessary configuration (e.g., URL for external source).
